💡 Idea

The application is an iOS app developed using SwiftUI, focused on supporting mental well-being and encouraging daily self-reflection.
Its main purpose is to provide users with a simple and calming space for motivation, reflection, and building positive habits without overwhelming them with too much content.

The app is designed to be minimalistic, user-friendly, and structured around consistent daily engagement.

🏗️ Architecture & Structure

The project is built using a modular approach with cleanly separated SwiftUI views and a well-structured data model.
The main development focus is placed on:

maintainability and scalability

simplicity in UI/UX

clear separation of features

clean and structured codebase

The overall architecture ensures that the application can easily be extended with additional content types and new features in the future.

🗓️ WidgetKit Integration

The application integrates WidgetKit to provide a calendar-based widget that enhances daily accessibility and user engagement.

The widget:

displays the current day using a dynamically changing emoji

automatically updates every day

works as a quick entry point into the application

opens a detailed calendar view when tapped

This allows users to interact with the app directly from their home screen, making daily check-ins more natural and effortless.

✅ Core Features
📅 Calendar-Based System

The app is structured around a calendar logic, where each day represents a unique entry point.
The calendar functions as the main navigation element and encourages users to return regularly.

🌟 Daily Generated Content

Each day, the application generates exactly one content type, ensuring the experience stays minimal and consistent.

Daily content can be:

a motivational message

a simple daily challenge

a reflection question

This design prevents content overload while supporting daily personal development and mental clarity.

🔄 Consistent Daily Engagement

Because content is tightly integrated with both the calendar system and the widget, the application naturally supports:

daily user interaction

habit-building routines

structured self-reflection
