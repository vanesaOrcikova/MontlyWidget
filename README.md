💡 Idea

The application is an iOS app developed using SwiftUI, focused on supporting mental well-being and encouraging daily self-reflection.
Its main purpose is to provide users with a simple and calming space for motivation, reflection, and building positive habits without overwhelming them with too much content. The app is designed to be minimalistic, user-friendly, and structured around consistent daily engagement.


🏗️ Architecture & Structure

The project is built using a modular approach with cleanly separated SwiftUI views and a well-structured data model.
The main development focus is placed on:

    •	maintainability and scalability
    •	simplicity in UI/UX
    •	clear separation of features
    •	clean and structured codebase


🗓️ WidgetKit Integration 

The application integrates WidgetKit to provide a calendar-based widget that enhances daily accessibility and user engagement.
The widget:

    •	displays the current day using a dynamically changing emoji
    •	automatically updates every day
    •	works as a quick entry point into the application
    •	opens a detailed calendar view when tapped
  
This allows users to interact with the app directly from their home screen, making daily check-ins more natural and effortless.

✅ Core Features

📅 Calendar-Based System

The app is structured around a calendar logic, where each day represents a unique entry point. The calendar functions as the main navigation element and encourages users to return regularly.


🌟 Daily Generated Content

Each day, the application generates exactly one content type, ensuring the experience stays minimal and consistent.
Daily content can be:

    •	a motivational message
    •	a simple daily challenge
    •	a reflection question
    
🔄 Consistent Daily Engagement
Because content is tightly integrated with both the calendar system and the widget, the application naturally supports:

    •	daily user interaction
    •	habit-building routines
    •	structured self-reflection

⚙️ Technologies Used

    •	SwiftUI – UI development and modular screen structure
    •	WidgetKit – home screen widget integration
    •	Calendar Logic – date-driven content generation and navigation
    •	Dynamic Emoji System – emoji updates automatically each day
    •	Clean Data Model – structured data handling for daily content


📌 App Flow Overview

    •	the user sees the widget on the home screen
    •	current day is shown using a dynamic emoji
    •	widget refreshes automatically every day
    •	the user taps the widget
    •	app opens directly into the detailed calendar view
    •	the user selects a specific day
    • one daily-generated content type is displayed:
        •	motivational message / daily challenge / reflection question
    •	process repeats the next day with new generated content
